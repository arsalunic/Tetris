Ultimate Tetris 3D
This is a Tetris Game written in C# using the Unity 3D Engine. 

//Movement control
Basic movement:

* A - move tile to left
* D - move tile to right
* S - move tile faster downwards
* R - rotate tile to right
* L - rotate tile to left

//Scoring system / tile speed
I tried to use the original scoring system as well as speed increments. Here are some resources I've used:

A huge thanks to Jeff and Arsalan, who helped me out on this one.
